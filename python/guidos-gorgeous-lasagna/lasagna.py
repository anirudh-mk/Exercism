# Hi There üëãüèΩ
# For much of the Python syllabus, we will provide function stubs + docstrings.
# These are the expected function names with details to help you get started solving the exercise.
# In general, they hint at expected functionality, along with expected input and return types.
#
# However, you can completely clear out the stubs before you start coding. We recommend that
# you keep them, because they are already set up to work with the tests, which you can find in
# ./lasagna_test.py. If the tests don't find the expected names, they will throw import errors.
#
# ‚ùóPLEASE NOTE‚ùó We are deviating a bit in this first exercise by asking you to practice defining
# functions & docstrings. We give you one completed stub below (bake_time_remaining), but have
# omitted the stubs and docstrings for the remaining two functions.
#
# We recommend copying the first stub + docstring, and then changing details like the function name
# and docstring text to match what is asked for in the #TODO comments and instructions.
# Once you have the correct stubs, you can get started with writing the code for each function body.
#
# ‚≠ê PS:  You should remove explanation comment blocks like this one, and should also
# remove any comment blocks that start with #TODO (or our analyzer will nag you about them)
